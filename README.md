# A *very* minimally styled personal website!
This is my personal website built on React. The goal with this was to keep the styling as simple as possible while making it easy to navigate. Blog posts are written in markdown and converted to HTML in the viewer.

You can check out the deployed website [here](www.hanjunyoung.com)!
